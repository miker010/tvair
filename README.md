# About this repository

Start your day with a report on your TV, informing you about the air quality and pollen levels for today and the coming days.

This is a simple (beginning of) tvOS app, which uses the Meteo Blue API. To use the app, you must obtain a (free) API key and enter it in the MeteoBlueApiConfiguration class. For more information, see: https://docs.meteoblue.com/en/weather-apis/free-weather-api/overview


# Requirements

* Xcode 15.3 or up, tvOS 17.4 support or up
* CocoaPods installed. This app uses CocoaPods to manage the Alamofire-dependency
